<h1>BlahajASM</h1>
<p>The Blahaj are now preparing to byte code manipulate your game. &gt;w&lt;</p>

<p>The main purpose of BlahajASM is to keep the features of FermiumASM without having to use FermiumBooter as i have a personal dislike of the requirement of a new mod</p>
<p>As with the original, BlahajASM makes multiple improvements, optimizations, and bug fixes to Minecraft, including but not limited to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Optimizing RAM usage, especially in larger packs.</li>
<li>Fixing multiple crashes, in Minecraft, Forge, and some other mods.</li>
<li>Multiple performance improvements.</li>
<li>Crash handling to allow you directly upload crash reports to <a href="https://mclo.gs/" rel="nofollow">mclo.gs</a>.</li>
</ul>
<p>Significant changes from CensoredASM:</p>
<ul>
<li>Removed built-in Spark profiling as it is both incompatible with, and superseded by, the updated fork <a href="https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/spark-unforged" rel="nofollow">Spark Unforged</a></li>
<li>Rebranded user-facing and logging branding to BlahajASM</li>
<li>Removed chance to pick and blame a random author in a crash</li>
<li>Updated mcmod.info to add fork author (me &gt;w&lt;), update url, and change icon</li>
</ul>
<p>As with the original, BlahajASM is incompatible with VanillaFix and TexFix as their functionalities have been improved and added directly to the mod.</p>
<p>Due to the changes made in this mod, if you have any issues, please report them to the linked issue tracker at the top for <a href="https://github.com/valiray/BlahajASM/issues" rel="nofollow">BlahajASM</a>, not the original mod.</p>
